ExpressionEngine-reCAPTCHA
==========================

Replaces the built-in ExpressionEngine 2.x CAPTCHA with reCAPTCHA on member registration and comment forms.

## Installation

1. Copy the **recaptcha** folder to **../system/expressionengine/third_party**
2. Enable and configure the extension via **Add-Ons... Extensions**
3. Remove the hard-coded CAPTCHA input field from your member registration template (**../themes/profile_themes/[theme_name]/registration_form.html**) and any comment submission form templates so that the CAPTCHA's conditional block looks like:

```
{if captcha}
    {captcha}
{/if}
```

### F.A.Q.

#### Can I use reCAPTCHA with the Contact or Tell-a-Friend form?

Currently the Email module uses its own functions for creating the CAPTCHA, so only member registration and comment forms are supported at this time.

#### Can I use this with the MSM?

It should work as long as you use a Global key by ticking **Enable this key on all domains (global key)** when you create your reCAPTCHA key.

#### I keep getting "Unable to receive your comment at this time." when testing the comment submission form?

If youâ€™re testing with the same comment text, EE is likely enforcing spam protection and/or throttling your post. Test with unique comments or adjust the settings at:

* Admin... Security and Session Preferences... Deny Duplicate Data
* Admin... Channel Administration... Channels... Comment Posting Preferences... Comment Re-submission Time Interval
